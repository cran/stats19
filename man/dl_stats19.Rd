\description{
Download STATS19 data for a year or range of two years.

\section{Details}{

This function downloads and unzips UK road crash data.
It results in unzipped .csv files that are put
in the temporary directory specified by \code{get_data_directory()} or provided \code{data_dir}.

The file downloaded would be for a specific year (e.g. 2017).
It could also be a file containing data for a range of two (e.g. 2005-2014).

The \verb{dl_*} functions can download many MB of data so ensure you
have a sufficient internet access and hard disk space.
